* I try to fix distance 1 spelling errors
* I read comments, mentions, submissions and PMs
* I know all collectible and some token cards (details below)
* To request ‚öî Duels cards, start with {duelsPrefix} as in [[{duelsPrefix}wish]]

* To celebrate the [Year of the Gryphon](https://playhearthstone.com/en-us/news/23620129): standard legal cards are tagged with: ü¶Ö
